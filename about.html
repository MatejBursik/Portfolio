                    Hi, my name is Matej Buršík and I am a software developer and a problem solver. I studied BSc in <span class="bold">Applied Computer Science</span> at Thomas More University of Applied Sciences. 
                    I am interested in <span class="bold">data science</span>, <span class="bold">AI development</span>, and <span class="bold">application development</span>. 
                    My preferred style of tasks are those which require creative problem solving and are of medium size. 
                    In my free time, I enjoy doing sports and working on my personal projects. I was born in Slovakia and decided to explore abroad for learning and job opportunities.

            <h2>Why did I choose Applied Computer Science at Thomas&nbspMore</h2>
            <p class="arial">
                Studying in a bilingual high school gave me the opportunity to look abroad for the options to continue my education. I applied to several universities around Europe 
                but at  the end, the courses in Applied Computer Science at Thomas More allied with my interests the most.
            </p>

                <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
                <p class="arial">
                    Lately, making programming projects became one of my hobbies. Overall, I prefer working with <span class="bold">Python</span>, <span class="bold">Rust</span> or <span class="bold">JavaScript</span> for these projects. 
                    When it comes to web applications, I enjoy working with <span class="bold">SpringBoot or Laravel</span>. 
                    As many programmers do, I also like to play <span class="bold">video games</span> and occasionally I try to make them. 
                    As a teenager, the interest in video game spark an interest in <span class="bold">computer animation</span> which became a hobby, and I studied on a low level. 
                    One of my minor hobbies is playing <span class="bold">board games</span>. For example, playing Chess, Root, and Dungeons & Dragons. Big part of my hobbies and interests are sports. 
                    There are several <span class="bold">sports</span> that I am interested in and do on regular bases. Sports like climbing and downhill longboarding are the once that I enjoy doing the most lately. 
                    I also enjoy doing other sports like skiing, surfing, and kayaking but these are a bit harder to do because they are more weather and location dependent. 
                    On the side of all these sports, I picked up a bit of <span class="bold">photography</span>. You can see some examples of my photo on the <a href="index.html">home page</a>.

                <h2>Future dreams and ambitions</h2>
                <p class="arial">
                    In the future, I would like to find a <span class="bold">job</span> related to <span class="bold">data science</span>, <span class="bold">AI development</span>, or <span class="bold">application development</span>. 
                    Yearly, I participate in <span class="bold">Advent of Code</span>. It is a programming competition hosted from 1st till 25th of December targeted towards data science and problem solving. 
                    They daily publish a task with two parts which result in 50 points. Last few years I managed to reach around 30 points and in future I would like to reach all 50 points. 
                    I enjoy working on these tasks because they challenge me creatively and analytically to find a suitable approach for the tasks. 
                    I would also like to work on some new personal projects. One of the projects that I started working on is a <span class="bold">video game</span> that I would like to publish at some point.  
                    In the future, I would also like to <span class="bold">travel</span> a bit more around Europe and Asia to experience different cultures. 
                    Lastly, I would like to improve at some sports that I am doing like <span class="bold">climbing and surfing</span>.
