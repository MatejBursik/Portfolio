                <p>
                    Hi, my name is Matej Buršík and I am a programmer and a problem solver. 
                    I am studying <a href="https://thomasmore.be/en/educations/degree-students/applied-computer-science/application-development/geel/full-programme">Applied Computer Science</a> 
                    at <a href="https://thomasmore.be/en">Thomas More</a> and I am interested in programming. I was born in Slovakia and decided to explore abroad, to be exact in Belgium.
                    My preferred style of tasks are one that require creative problem solving, that's why like to work on some small personal projects.

            <h2>Why did I choose Applied&nbspcomputer&nbspscience at Thomas&nbspMore</h2>
            <p>
                Studying in a bilingual high school gave me the opportunity the look abroad for the option to continue my education. I applied to several universities around Europe but at 
                the end, course Applied computer science at Thomas more became the best option. The course suited my interests and was financially viable.

                <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
                <p>
                    Making small programming projects lately became one of my hobbies. Overall, I prefer using Python for these projects and HTML with JavaScript for simple games.
                    I have started learning and using C++ for developing locally executable applications. By using C++, I learn more about the inner working of operating systems and hardware.
                    Big part of my hobbies and interests are sports. There are many sports that I am interested in and do on regular bases. Sport climbing and Downhill longboarding are the once that 
                    I enjoy doing the most lately. I still enjoy doing other sports like Skiing and Kayaking but these are a bit harder to do because they are more weather and location dependent.
                    As many programmers do, I also like to play Video games and occasionally I try to make some Video games.
                    The interest in Video game spark an interest in Computer animation which became a hobby a studied on a low level.
                    One of my smaller hobbies is playing board games. For example, chess, especially solving chess puzzles.

                <h2>Future dreams and ambitions</h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, I would like to find Data Science or Web design related job since those are the fields that I am the most interested.
                    Yearly, I participate in <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a>. It is a competition host December. They daily publish a task with two parts which result in 50 points.
                    Last view years I managed to reach around 30 points and in future I would like to reach all 50 points. I enjoy working on these tasks because they challenge me 
                    creatively and analytically to find a suitable approach for the tasks.
                    I make somewhat frequently small projects on different topics. In the future I would like to expand on some of the projects and make more new projects.
                    One of the projects is to publish a video game. I have several ideas for different games which I might start working on.
                    In the next few year, I would like to also travel a bit more around Europe and Asia.
                    Lastly, I would like to improve at sports that I am doing like climb a more difficult climbs and I would like to learn some new sports like surfing.
