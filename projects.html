            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p id="description">
                Utopia project was a task where our group was meant to created something that would let people experience some aspects of computer science 
                in a fun interactive way. We decided to make a dungeon navigation game operated by writing commands as inputs. 
                The commands resembled the structure of lines of code commonly found in programming languages. Overall, it was meant to simulate a command line operated environment 
                which are frequent in the computer science field. I worked mostly on the input parser, and command identification and execution, 
                but I also helped out with the menus, error handling, structuring the code, and testing.
            </p>
            <h3>Reason</h3>
            <p id="reason">
                This project was part of a Professional skills 1 course at Thomas More. The purpose of this project was to make an interactive method 
                for people to identify the field they would enjoy studying. This project also sparked an interest in game development outside of game engines.
            </p>
            <h3 id="wilH3">What I learned</h3>
            <p id="wil">
                Thank to this project, I learned working and structuring a medium size programming project. Since it was a group project communication and teamwork were important. 
                The project background was given to us by a client who was later the judge of it. This thought me how to develop more based on the client's vision than my own vision. 
                From the technical side, I improved my understanding of Pygame which is a Python game making library. Also, since it was a medium sized project, my documentation 
                in a form of code comments improved, so that others would understand code that I have written.

            <h2 id="title">DFS (Depth First Search) Maze generation</h2>
            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p id="description">
                This project covers a process of generating a maze using randomized DFS. The process involves treating the maze as a grid of cells and carving out paths 
                between cells in a randomized manner which creates a maze that has a single connected path with no loops. The maze generation uses randomized DFS as the algorithm to create the maze. 
                Depth First Search (DFS) is an algorithm used in computer science for traversing or searching through data structures, for example trees and graphs. 
                The algorithm is placed in a basic Pygame game loop for visualization. Lastly, after the application window is exited, I use cv2 the make and save an image out of the maze.

            <h3>Reason</h3>
            <p id="reason">
                Reason for this project was that I wanted to practice programming of some basic algorithm, like the DFS. These basic algorithms are wide used in many different 
                computer science disciplines like artificial intelligence, data science, networking, or bioinformatics.

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p id="description">
                This project is a command line program which is going to compile your frames into an animated video. As someone who does animations occasionally, I wanted a very simple tool to make my images 
                into a video. Since, I am also a programmer, I decided to make one. This was the first time I used cv2 (computer vision 2) library in a project.
            </p>
            <h3>Reason</h3>
            <p id="reason">
                I wanted to make a tool for me to easily compile frames of an animation into a video format.

            <h3 id="wilH3">What I learned</h3>
            <p id="wil">
                As mentioned in the description, this was the first project where I used cv2. It is a complex library, and this project became a starting stone for learning how to use the library. 
                This was also the first time I made a command line program in python which also required me to learn about libraries os and sys which interact with the operating system in a way that 
                I can collect arguments for the program and find the images for the animation. Since, I wanted this tool to be used also by others, I had to learn and make decent documentation on 
                how to use it without the user needing to read the actual code. You can find it in the GitHub link below.

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p id="description">
                The MEMENTO project was a group project in which we create an application analysis for a client. I took the role of a team lead in this group. 
                In this role, I had to mainly made decisions about the work allocation, but I still worked on all sorts of tasks other than just management like working on 
                the Use case diagram or writing descriptions for the document. Our group was well balanced, and communication was not an issue, so most decisions were made collectively. 
                Our group was talking to a potential customer, and we were made to analyse the customers vision for the application by producing a report. 
                Specifically, we were talking to a person with memory issues. They wanted us to create a calendar application meant to help people with those memory issues in day to day life. 
                The focus group of the application were people from 18 to 50 with those issues and people in their circles. For the report, our task was to provide background information, 
                create a Use case diagram with descriptions, a non-functional requirements analysis, provide a priority by functionality using the MoSCoW method, and a high-fidelity prototype made in Axure.

            <p id="description">
                This project is my way of testing out a new programming language that I am interested in working with. I made simple list of requirements for the application which are 
                test visualizations, execution speed, code verboseness, and user interaction capabilities. The premise of the actual application is simple. 
                Simulate falling sand when it is spawned periodically from one spot and spawn on the cursor while the user is holding down left mouse button. 
                The idea for falling sand visualization comes from 'The Coding Train' on Youtube and I wanted to expand on it by challenging myself to work with different programming languages. 
                This project is technically ongoing since I plan on making it in other languages which I have not used yet.

                Started with me wanting to learn about noise generation and visualizing it, inspired by 'The Coding Train' on Youtube. 
                Then it started to spiral more into a game development experiment, with focus on learning Rust and OpenGL. 
                This project is ongoing since I plan on integrating more game features and learning more while doing so.

            <p id="reason">
                After the spark from Utopia project, I started looking into different way of making video games. In the end, I landed on Rust with OpenGL. 
                Rust because of its high performance, memory safety, and good mix of high-level functionalities with low-level control. 
                OpenGL because if its cross-platform compatibility and it being good for learning graphics fundamentals.
            </p>

            <p id="wil">
                This is my first proper Rust project, so I learned a lot about code in Rust. I also learned quite a bit about OpenGL and how to use it to develop an application. 
                Additionally, I learned about github workflows since I wanted to make a simple deployment for people who do not want to compile it on their own.

                Additionally, since the application is storing passwords, it needs to be secure. So, I had to refresh my knowledge on encryption and hashing, and then 
                figure out how to implement it into code.

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p id="description">
                Project focusing on hosting a dataset for a data analysis project (<a href=" https://github.com/MatejBursik/Earthquake_analysis" target="_blank">data analysis repo</a>) 
                using Docker to containerize Java backend API, React frontend, and a MySQL database.
            </p>
            <h3>Reason</h3>
            <p id="reason">
                I wanted to host data on an API for a data analysis project. This would simulate a realistic scenario since it is common to retrieve data from APIs. 
                I also wanted to practise working with Java SpringBoot for the backend and learn about React for the frontend.
            </p>
            <h3 id="wilH3">What I learned</h3>
            <p id="wil">
                I learned React for the frontend and practised Java SpringBoot for the backend API.
